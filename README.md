<h3>What is Sparkle?</h3>

The current state of Windows is rough. Broken updates, preinstalled junk, background services, and telemetry that run whether you want them or not.

Sparkle can't fix all of Windows problems, but it can help you debloat your PC, improve performance, and reduce latency.

<h3>Why Should I Optimize Windows?</h3>

A default Windows installation comes with pre installed apps you didn't ask for or that you will never use for such as telemetry running in the background and services eating up resources for features you'll never use.

Optimizing is about cutting that unnecessary overhead so more of your PC's resources gos to what actually matters such as gaming, rendering, or just a snappier desktop experience.

Everything Sparkle does can also be done manually, but that doesn't mean you should have to

# FAQ

### Is Sparkle safe to use?

Yes. Sparkle is fully open source with the GPL-V3 licence meaning anyone can view, edit or build the code themselves. Currently there is no CI/CD yet. If you perfer you can clone the repo and build Sparkle yourself read here: <a href="#building-sparkle">Building Sparkle</a>

### Does Sparkle impove performance?

Depends. Every tweak and utility has been tested on real hardware. None of the tweaks are AI-generated, blindly added, or untested. None of the tweaks are made up, and there are no fake registry values or anything like that. Performance improvements depend on your hardware any what you apply in Sparkle.

### Can i undo changes made by Sparkle?

Yes, all tweaks are reversible. You can either use Sparkle's tweak reverse or a system restore point.

### Why does Sparkle ask for admin permissions?

Admin permissions are required to apply system-level tweaks and optimizations and using/creating restore points.

### Why does Windows Defender/Smartscreen Block Sparkle

Sparkle is not currently signed since it costs a lot for an open source project. When you run an unsigned exe on Windows it automatically assumes it's unsafe and blocks it.

You can get around it by:

Click "More info" → "Run anyway".
